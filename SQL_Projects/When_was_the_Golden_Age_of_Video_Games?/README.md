<p>Video games are big business: the global gaming market is projected to be worth more than $300 billion by 2027 according to <a href="https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/global-gaming-market">Mordor Intelligence</a>. With so much money at stake, the major game publishers are hugely incentivized to create the next big hit. But are games getting better, or has the golden age of video games already passed?</p>
<p>In this project, we'll explore the top 400 best-selling video games created between 1977 and 2020. We'll compare a dataset on game sales with critic and user reviews to determine whether or not video games have improved as the gaming market has grown.</p>
<p>Our database contains two tables. We've limited each table to 400 rows for this project, but you can find the complete dataset with over 13,000 games on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/holmjason2/videogamedata">Kaggle</a>. </p>
