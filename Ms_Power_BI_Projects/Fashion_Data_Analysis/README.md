# Fashion Data Analysis

# Introduction
Design firms are harnessing the power of data to maximize their product offerings by improving clothing quality and performance and analyzing clothing trends to improve merchandising strategies.
Data analytics can be applied by the fashion industry in several ways, starting with how and what designers create and how brands market their products. It is useful in analyzing trends, consumer behavior, and preferences.

# Problem Statatement
The fashion market is a very competitive environment; therefore, brands and designers have to constantly produce new and innovative products to meet their customers’ demands. There are different qualities, prices, degrees, and reputations for each brand. Thus, the issue of how exactly to maximize their business models so that they can meet their customers’ demands for diversity and inclusion arises.
This study examines and summarizes the properties of different apparel and their effect on its price, and it discusses the development direction of fashion design.

# Goals and objectives
The objective of this research is to help the management make informed decisions, such as predicting price and product demand and generating insights about trends and customer preferences.

# Results and Discussion
This shows the results of data collected from an e-commerce platform. User-generated content reflects consumers’ most instinctive awareness of products and can be used as an important reference for manufacturers to make product decisions.
We can use consumer ratings to evaluate their attitudes towards products. We can also evaluate competing brands and use product rating counts to predict product demand and market changes.
We can confirm that several proactive fashion brands such as Roadster, Tokyo Talkies, Sassafras, Vishudh, Anouk, Mitera, Sangria, Street 9, and Kalini (to mention a few) are seen taking full advantage of their online presence.

The counts from the chart of product attributes have shown that several product attributes such as fabric, pattern, occasion, types, measurements, color, and length can indeed help in predicting features of interest for fashion businesses and help forecast product trends; they could also be an effective integral part of subsequent brand designs.

The scatterplot shows that a relationship exists between the average rating of the apparel and their rating count and prices; this can be used to better estimate product demand.

Checking the Effect of Rating and Demand on Price, we could see that most apparel with high prices is poorly rated or not rated, while apparel with moderate prices is well rated. So, we can conclude that apparel with low and moderate prices is in high demand, while apparel with high prices is in low demand.

# Conclusion
This project has uncovered various areas where data analytics can be utilized and implemented, including: (1) predicting product demand; (2) determining the relevant production scale and reducing unnecessary waste; (3) investigating and improving the consumer experience; and (4) enhancements in business performance.
